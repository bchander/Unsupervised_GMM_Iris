# Unsupervised_GMM_Iris
Unsupervised clustering of Iris Data using Gaussian Mixture Model

A simple code demonstrating the application of Expectation Maximization technique for parameters estimation of Gausssian Mixture Models (GMM) on Iris Data step in 2D. 

 Original implementation of the code was done by McDickenson available here - https://github.com/mcdickenson/em-gaussian
considering two gaussian mixture model. This code modified the original work by
Taking Iris input rather than sampling data from Gaussian
